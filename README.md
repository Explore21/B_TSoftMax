# B_TSoftMax / Keras version of TSoftMax from A t-distribution based operator for enhancing out of distribution robustness of neural network classifiers



From Last line of the : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05389.pdf

It is envisaged that in the cases where t-softmax fails to outperform the baseline, further modifications of the NN architectures and better understanding of the effect of the parameter Î½ could lead to more positive results.
